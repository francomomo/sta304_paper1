## Abstract 

Most Canadians consider Canada to be a safe place to live in, but they consider Toronto to be less safer than the smalls towns and rural areas in Canada. In this paper, we conducted analysis to investigate the Major Crimes in Toronto from 2014 to 2019 to learn about the criminal offence landscape. We found that Toronto's crime worsed from 2014 to 2019 but it got slightly better during the pandemic. This report can also act as a guide for individuals and families to learn about the most/least occurred criminal offences and the safest and the least safest neighborhoods in Toronto.
